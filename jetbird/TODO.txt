note: these are all very rough ideas.

- possibly implement trackback? (http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec)
- make jetbird someday modular, although it is already a bit modular
- make a framework to allow plugins (opensocial??)
	after some googling i found this: http://coding.derkeiler.com/pdf/Archive/PHP/php.general/2007-08/msg00310.pdf
	could be useful
- dynamic template generator? (XML,...)
 
resources:  http://www.phppatterns.com seems to have some good resources on patterns.
